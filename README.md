Welcome to my Data Visualization Project! Here is my project on the Sleep Epidemic within Canada.

Here is a link to the statistics/research

Here is also a public link to the project

Link not working? I have also attached a PDF and GIF of the project on this repository as well !

The GIF version is simply animation of the clock on the top left side running down the time from midnight to early morning
